## Introduction

This Template is to help mission makers that are currently creating maps or those ambitious new members begin their map making careers. Included in the template repository are the necessary building blocks to get started. 

## Included

In the repository you will find the necessary compositions, modules, and scripts needed to run on our server.

## Downloading from Github

To make it easier on everyone, I will not show you how to use Git and Github since these can be a bit confusing for the inexperienced in version control software/platforms. So to make it easier you can just download a zipped version of this repository without having to deal with all the intracies of version control. Your Welcome!

## Checklist

1. Create an empty mission in the Eden Editor on any map.
2. Go to your default profile folder location. Mine is at "C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\ProfileNameHere".
3. In the missions folder, there should be your empty mission that only includes a mission.sqm, you will now copy the contents of the *Blank Template*. Next you can change the description.ext to add your name, mission name, and mission description.
4. Now you will backtrack to the compositions folder at the same location of the missions folder ( Here if you don't remember "C:\Users\YourUsernameHere\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\ProfileNameHere"). You will then copy the folders inside of the *Compositions Template* folder to your own compositions folder. 
5. Now you will have all available modules, scripts, and multiplayer units ready for your mission making abilities.
